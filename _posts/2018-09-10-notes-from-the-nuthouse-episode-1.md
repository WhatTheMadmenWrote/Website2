<h2>Notes from the Nuthouse</h2>
<h3>Episode 1</h3>
Hi, and welcome to “Notes from the Nuthouse,” my attempt at a podcast, and really a chance to help summarize everything that has been accomplished so far regarding the planned zine, What the Madmen Wrote.

If things work out, maybe I’ll record another one. Anybody with comments or questions they would like to share in response to this episode are welcome to post inside the #livechat channel inside Discord. Or, send me an email at <a href="mailto:jon@gazerbeam.com">jon@gazerbeam.com</a> with the word “podcast” somewhere in either the subject line or the body of the message.PAGE_BREAK: PageBreak

So, here is what I know so far:
<ul>
 	<li>The title of the zine will be, “What the Madmen Wrote.” I might have already mentioned that.</li>
 	<li>The first zine will come out in October, and it will have a Halloween theme. The first issue will also contain two stories and it will be distributed as both a printed and an electronic version.PAGE_BREAK: PageBreak</li>
</ul>
We have launched a website for the zine at http://monkshood.gazerbeam.com. “Monkshood” was the proposed name of the fictional asylum where the stories were written.

A lot of our discussion and planning is still taking place inside the Discord server, where all of this began. There is also a Github project where I’ve been managing the technical work on the website at https://github.com/WhatTheMadmenWrote.

A Facebook page has also been launched at https://www.facebook.com/Whatthemadmenwrote.

There have been a few questions about where everything lives, our flow, etc. This is something that has been slowly coming into shape, and I don’t have all of the answers. But, given that we are producing a publication, I’ve tried to approach this as an editorial process. We need a intake for submissions, we need a place to edit content, and we need a way to publish the content.

Here are my thoughts on some of the more common questions:
<ol>
 	<li>Where do we publish submissions? Go to http://monkshood.gazerbeam.com, click “Submit,” and then use the form to submit your story. You can also email in submissions to <a href="mailto:story@monkshood.gazerbeam.com">story@monkshood.gazerbeam.com</a>. Submissions can be attached word files, or links to Google docs.</li>
 	<li>Where do we edit the submitted stories? I would start by logging into Podio, the application we are using to manage the stories that are submitted to us. Once you’ve logged in, make sure you are in the workspace for “What the Madmen Wrote,” then click “Guest Authors.” The page you land on will contain a list of stories that are available to review. There is one that is an actual story, while the rest are test content.</li>
 	<li>Where do I submit a change request for the website, an idea, or an issue? I would post these as issues inside Github. Navigate to the project there, then click on “Projects,” or click on the “Website2” repository and then “Issues.” Or you can send a note to me at <a href="mailto:jon@gazerbeam.com">jon@gazerbeam.com</a>.</li>
</ol>

As I’ve been thinking about the future for the zine, it seemed to me that we really needed a way to to grow a strong writer’s community. If we attract a good group of writers and make it easy for them to write and share their works, then it will be easy to pick from what they post and publish it in the zine.

In fact, if we play our cards right we shouldn’t even have a difficult time finding content for future issues of the zine. We just pull the best stories from the community.

At the same time, however, we would want to be careful not to release the stories to the general public, because then there is no longer any sense of discovery when the zine comes out, and so little motivation for someone to buy the publication.

So, tonight I launched a members’ only community site for writers which all of us from the Discord server can join, and then we can invite other writers. This site is at http://queue.gazerbeam.com. Within the site, we can share stories, offer feedback, discuss writing tips, without revealing too much. I did, however, set up a submission form which visitors would be able to use to submit their stories directly to us. We would then invite the author to participate in the community, polish their story, and work alongside us as it goes to press.

Eventually, I think that this site could replace Podio and streamline our editorial process.

But, I am open to suggestions.PAGE_BREAK: PageBreak

Finally, I think that audio or even video could play a part in the promotion of our zine. I can imagine posting audio versions of the stories posted in the members only site, so there is a choice of either reading or listening to stories.

If there are future episodes of “Notes from the Nuthouse,” perhaps the next one could focus on introducing everybody from the discord server.

So, this is Jon Morgan signing off. If you need to reach me, you can find me on the discord server, or you can contact me at <a href="mailto:jon@gazerbeam.com">jon@gazerbeam.com</a>.

Thanks for listening.
