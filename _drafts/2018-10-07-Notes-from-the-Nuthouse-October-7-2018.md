<h2>Why I love Halloween</h2>
As October goes on, I become increasingly more excited for Halloween. Truth be told, I am a lover of all things macabre and horrific, and so this month’s holiday is obviously something that I anticipate throughout the year. But what makes people like Halloween? Is it that people can dress in costumes and be somebody else, that surely has got to be at least a small part of it. On a daily basis people throughout the world wish they could be celebrities or cartoon characters, something that personally I have never been drawn to. As a young kid becoming a werewolf was always my dream, even though I was scared to death by most things, I think I must have thought that if I became one I would instantly find that everything else couldn't be as scary as that. Weird.

Children obviously love Halloween for the sweets and candy, although that has in itself become a little more sinister, facebook posts (and before those, tales) of razor blades in chocolate bars and poisoned apples. It speaks volumes about how we westerners have to be suspicious about everything, becoming increasingly neurotic making us think goodness can't spawn from nothing and to be suspicious of the pleasant man on the next street over who is always extra nice to children.

Halloween to me is an excuse to drag people into my own world, making my friends and family watch horror movies that perfectly display, at least in my opinion, Halloween in spirit. Sometimes they love it, sometimes they don't, and more often than not my other half insists that we don't need to watch “Ghostwatch” again this year whilst we gut pumpkins in nothing but candlelight.

I think the main reason I love Halloween so much is that it brings people who don't usually enjoy what I love to my awareness. Friends of friends suddenly reveal that they believe in ghosts, and if you want, they'll tell you about the time their aunt saw a ghostly dog. It speaks to the basal instinct in all of us to tell stories, and interact and just generally talk when the rest of the world becomes increasingly more closed off.

To me, Halloween is human interaction at its best.
