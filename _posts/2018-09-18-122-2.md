<span style="font-weight: 400">The clear Halloween night helped the full moon paint a silver doorway onto the wall of Beth’s room, things finally felt in place. She had laid there for hours, patiently watching this calming window of light slowly move down from the wall and over onto the bed. She’s been waiting, willing this visit, in her thoughts continually to the point that she feels in contact. The luminous block slowly inched across the bed and crept over her body, framing her in moonlight. The temperature dropped, static fizzed across her skin sending hairs on end, the presence is here. Beth started this, constantly calling back in grief, unable to let go.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Her twin, Alice, was taken that summer, while on vacation up in the forest. They would both wake early and sneak off down to the lake to swim, they loved the mists that formed on the surface at dawn. Enveloped by the cold fog,swimming in circles, mirroring each other, cut off from the world, feeling like two ethereal beings. Until eventually tiring and finding themselves floating, contemplating the shore and their isolation. Beth commented on the beautiful silence, but received no answer, she turned and saw nothing but calm water. Alice was gone. She dived deep in panic, searching with bursting lungs, until she couldn’t continue. Her arms and chest failed her, those knotted black weeds clung to her twin and kept her down.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">The bitter blend of guilt and grief devastated her, not a day passed that her sister wasn’t in her thoughts. No amount of counselling could soothe her, it built up like mould on her mind, until twelve nights ago when the presence first visited. It came to her each following night, she told no one not even her counsellor Christine. Each time she felt the connection grow deeper, she wasn’t under its spell, nor is it under hers. She was not lost to this world, neither was she weakened in any way, it was only at these moments that she felt respite. When mornings came they were again pulled apart by dark grasping fingers, waking isolated and still, waiting for it’s return.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400">Tonight feels different, the presence is more powerful, she’s certain Alice will return fully. A faint mist formed within the silver frame of moonlight. She smiled and inhaled the safe familiar spirit, her airways closed and her breathing stopped. She didn’t fight it, she embraced it, surrendering herself over. Her thought were soaked with the presence, swirling in on themselves just as they did when swimming in the mist covered waters. Her body lifted from the bed, rising gently, she felt no up or down, only her nightdress showed the pull of gravity.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">She was held stationary for a moment, her limbs paralysed, composed, staring at the ceiling and listening, hearing only the faint sound of running water. She felt the pull on her body and drifted gently to the door and out. The sound of water grew ever louder and was joined by her sister’s voice calling her. The bathroom was even cooler, the increasing rushing of the bath taps filled her ears, drowning out her thoughts. Then silence... the taps were off. A pull at her nightgown turned her over, face down over the bathtub she saw herself mirrored in the water. She was pulled towards her reflected sister until face to face, her eyes closed, peaceful under the surface. Beth’s wide eyes stared with elation, joyful tears welled up on her lashes and fell away from her face into thel water.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Suddenly the sleeping twin woke revealing only her eyes as black holes, her face pulled itself into a hideous smile. The grotesque mouth opened as if to speak, but twisted dark weed unfurled from it and rose to the surface. Further ribbons of blackness spewed out from the eyes and nose, spiralling in on themselves like a knot of snakes. Beth felt sick to the pit of her stomach, this wasn't her Alice, just her body used as a vessel for something sickening, she tried in vain to break from the hold. The black lifted out from the water inches from her face, she strained her neck away with such pressure she thought she could pass out. Reaching and searching, they came twisting up, homing in for her mouth and eyes. Beth desperately clamped them shut, she felt them probing against her lids and lips, working their way in. The bitter taste of the lake in her mouth once again.</span>
