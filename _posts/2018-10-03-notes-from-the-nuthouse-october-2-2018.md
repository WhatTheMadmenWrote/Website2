It is October, a month that is usually dedicated to macabre tales of ghosts, witches, vampires, and werewolves. It is also a fitting month for the launch of a new website dedicated to flash horror, called <i>What the Mad Men Wrote</i>. Details are still sketchy, but word has it that the stories found within the website have all been submitted by the patients at Monkshood Asylum. More information will follow.

As the residents of Monkshood do not want to hog all of the spotlight, they have asked me to invite others to submit their stories to the website also. Post a story by clicking on “Post Story” inside the navigation menu located towards the very top of the homepage.

Visitors who have a passion for writing can join the site for free by clicking on “Register.” No note from the doctor is required. Membership on the site allows you to vote for your favorite stories, and help edit stories that are in progress.

Everybody is also welcome to join our <a href="https://discord.gg/7mhP6Bk">Discord serve</a>r. This is a place to meet other writers, ask questions, and share story ideas.

Anybody who has questions can contact the staff at <a href="mailto:monkshood@gazerbeam.com">monkshood@gazerbeam.com</a>.

But, please keep the stories coming. <i>What the Mad Men Wrote</i> will be around long after October ends. I guess you could say that this is a project we are all committed to.
