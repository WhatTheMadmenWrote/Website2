The cemetery in Bradstown Pennsylvania is crowded. I always noticed that. I grew up here and the grave markers always looked like they were fit too tightly together, like gnarled teeth ingrown, rowed and double rowed in a bad mouth. Like the teeth of a shark. I didn’t want to be buried there.

I didn't even die. I’m not even dead.

You know that feeling you get when something shocks you, and for just an instant your blood feels cold and it feels like every particle in your body vibrates wildly before suddenly dropping into paralysis? The world spins around you, but you stay frozen. I woke up this morning with that feeling, only it remained for longer than a split second.

My mom came in and called my name. My sister came in and screamed. The doctors came in and tried to make me move, but I couldn’t, so they took me away. I tried to move. I tried to scream. I tried to shout at the top of my lungs, “I’m not dead! I’m not dead!” but it was no use.

I saw the halloween lights go up, all of the pumpkins burning and I heard the ghoulish cries of all the tacky robotic lawn decorations, and I thought to myself, “Is this some kind of elaborate halloween prank? Whoever is doing this, it isn’t funny.”

It wasn’t funny when they put me in the box. It wasn’t funny when they shoveled dirt over it either. It wasn’t funny when I cried and pounded and clawed and screamed on the lid of my coffin.

<i>I’m not dead!</i>

<i> </i>“I’m not dead!”

I’m not dead!

What was funny, just a little bit funny, mind you, was the knock I heard in response; not from above, but to the left of me. Then a voice said, “Hey buddy, I’m not dead either.”

A new fear seized me, as I knew the voice I heard could only be coming from the grave next to mine.

There was another knock, this time from the right, “Me either. No one here is dead.”

As soon as this happened I started laughing. A weird sort of peace came over me. I imagined those age old corpses, decayed, skeletal, toothless and eyeless, laying in the ground next to me, one to the left and one to the right, knocking on the walls of their coffins.

“I’m sorry.” I said, suddenly feeling self conscious about all of my shouting, and once I said it, my nerves started to calm. My heartbeat slowed.

“Hey, it’s okay. Just try to keep it down. It’s past our bedtime.”

I gazed up at the lit of my coffin, my eyes slowly adjusting to the pitch black of the total darkness that surrounded me, and I made out shapes and patterns in the woodwork.

“Happy Halloween, buddy.” said the voice next to the left.

“Happy Halloween.” I answered, then I decided to take a nap.
