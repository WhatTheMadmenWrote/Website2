My name is Nathan Miller, and I am not mad, though perhaps I wish I was. If belief in life after death makes one a lunatic, then we should have to burst through the doors of churches and take in millions. However, I am not like them, for, while they have faith, I have knowledge, and how I wish I did not.

I am not a man who is regularly prone to act on emotion. In fact, when my beloved Cecily, light of my life, perished in the most gratuitous fashion, having her head crushed to pieces beneath the wheels of a ravenous vehicle, even then I had less of a reaction than I believe is supposed to be healthy and normal. I was not sobbing or fanatical. I simply and logically decided that I should find a way to speak with her from beyond the grave.

I studied things, things that should not be studied. I googled things, things that should not be googled. I even looked upon accursed PDF scans of that dread volume called The Necronomicon. I had no desire to speak with Elder Things or raise Devils. I wanted only to see the graceful, full form of My Cecily H. Miller once, and I assured myself that this was no great crime or blasphemy. This was good magic. Not evil.

I purchased the blood of goats through relatively legal means.

They say that All-Hallow’s Eve is the night where the world of the living and the world of the dead are closest. While children dressed in mocking costumes of the dead and pounded on their neighbor’s doors for alms, I dressed myself in a crimson robe and knocked on the gate of Heaven.

I set up my altar in the basement, with my two chalices of blood, my signs and symbols within a circle carved on the floor. I took a lock of Cecily’s raven hair, I lit it with a candle, and I said the ancient words as they were written in the dread volume of Abdul Alhazred. I shall not write the words here. I do not wish for anyone to duplicate my process.

Soon, she materialized, and she was just as I remembered, bright eye’d, lovely in form and figure, 5’3 with a small scar beside her left eye. I smiled. She did not.

“Nathan are you there?”

I heard a voice speaking, but it did not sound like hers, and she did not open her mouth. Never the less, I spoke back, thinking that perhaps speaking across the chasm of death was like talking over a bad telephone connection. “I am here.”

I don’t know if she heard me, for the voice then launched into a monologue of its own, “Nathan, I am afraid. I am lost. I see nothing, nor can I even remember seeing. There is nothing but darkness here, and there has been nothing but darkness since the beginning. I feel a crawling in my skin, a burning in my blood, and there is no rest. I’m frightened, so very frightened, and I wander because sitting still is even greater agony. Everything is dark, and something moves in the darkness. By God and Satan I wish it would find me. I hope that it will find me and end my suffering for good, but I fear there is no end.”

I was already in a cold sweat, but I was taken aback even further when I saw something like black, rotten vines extent around her torso, pulling her inward, as if through a doorway. More vines grew, pulling at her legs, arms and stomach, and she twisted and writhed, struggling against them.

I heard her scream of agony as she was torn away from me, and I hear it still. I hear it always and know that I am not mad. How could I not be mad? How could I remain sane knowing that my one love, who I have lived with, embraced, comforted in the face of fears and shared my heart with is suffering a hideous, eternal torment? I cannot bare it, and I wish that I could make up my mind to take the leap from my fifteenth story window and end my thinking, only, I fear that I too should join her their in that dark place.

I know I will. I know it is only a matter of time.
